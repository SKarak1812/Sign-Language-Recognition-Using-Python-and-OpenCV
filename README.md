# Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Python-and-OpenCV
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.  We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.
